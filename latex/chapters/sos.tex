\section{Simulation Engines}
Simulation is a cornerstone in understanding and optimizing urban traffic flow, playing a central role in my research on optimizing traffic light control through reinforcement learning. In this section, we emphasize the significance of simulating urban mobility, highlighting key components and methodologies.

In the context of my study, conducting real-world experiments to investigate traffic dynamics and assess traffic light control strategies can be impractical and costly. Simulation offers a safe, efficient, and cost-effective alternative.

Simulation allows us to create virtual replicas of urban environments, accurately modeling traffic conditions, vehicle behaviors, and interactions between various elements. This enables researchers to observe and analyze traffic patterns, congestion, and the outcomes of different control strategies without resorting to physical experiments.

Urban mobility simulation comprises several critical components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traffic Models:} These define how vehicles and pedestrians move within the simulation, offering microscopic, macroscopic, or hybrid perspectives.
    \item \textbf{Road Network Representation:} Accurate representation of the road network, including road types, lanes, intersections, and constraints.
    \item \textbf{Vehicle Dynamics:} Parameters like acceleration, deceleration, and turning behavior are modeled to simulate realistic traffic.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Control Systems:} Various control systems such as traffic lights, stop signs, and pedestrian crossings are integrated into simulations.
\end{itemize}

Simulation methodologies include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent-Based Simulation:} Modeling individual entities as autonomous agents, facilitating fine-grained analysis.
    \item \textbf{Microscopic Simulation:} Focusing on individual vehicle behaviors for detailed analysis.
    \item \textbf{Macroscopic Simulation:} Analyzing traffic flow at a higher level, treating vehicles as flow units.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SUMO}
Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO)\cite{SUMO2018} is a widely used open-source traffic simulation software designed for modeling and simulating urban transportation systems. Developed in Python, SUMO provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, urban planners, and traffic engineers to analyze and optimize urban traffic flow.

    \item \textbf{Public Transport}: The software can simulate public transportation systems, including buses, trams, and subways, making it valuable for studying multimodal transportation in urban areas.
    
    \item\textbf{Traffic Demand Generation}: Users can generate realistic traffic demand patterns, including origin-destination matrices, to model the movement of people and vehicles within the urban environment.
\end{itemize}


SUMO finds applications in various domains, including:

Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO)\cite{SUMO2018} plays a pivotal role in enhancing our understanding of urban traffic dynamics and optimizing traffic flow. Its flexibility, extensibility, and open-source nature make it a valuable resource for studying and improving urban mobility systems.


\subsection{CityFlow}
The widely used public traffic simulator, SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)\cite{SUMO2018}, has limitations in terms of scalability to accommodate large road networks and traffic flows. The authors mention that SUMO's performance deteriorates significantly when simulating extensive road networks and a high volume of vehicles, particularly when interfacing with Python for reinforcement learning support. In contrast, the authors introduce their novel traffic simulator, CityFlow\cite{zhang2019cityflow}, which addresses these limitations. CityFlow offers multithreading capabilities and is the first open-source simulator designed to support city-wide traffic simulation. It offers flexibility in defining road networks, vehicle models, and traffic signal plans, boasting a simulation speed over twenty times faster than SUMO. Additionally, the authors provide a user-friendly interface tailored for reinforcement learning experiments.

The introduction of CityFlow not only holds promise for optimizing traffic signal control but also opens avenues for various large-scale transportation research studies, such as vehicle routing through mobile apps and traffic jam prevention. Furthermore, CityFlow may serve as a benchmark reinforcement learning environment for transportation studies, similar to OpenAI Gym. The authors also express their intention to enhance the simulator by calibrating simulation parameters using real-world observations, thereby generating both fast and "real" data samples.

This paper explores the capabilities and potential applications of CityFlow, emphasizing its contribution to addressing urban traffic control challenges and advancing transportation research through reinforcement learning.

\subsection{Chosen Option: SUMO}
When selecting a simulation tool for my research on optimizing urban traffic flow using reinforcement learning-based traffic light control, it was essential to consider the strengths and weaknesses of available options. In this section, we elaborate on my choice of Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) over CityFlow, another prominent simulation testbed.

Zhang et al. (2019)\cite{zhang2019cityflow} introduced CityFlow as a simulation testbed for urban traffic management. However, a critical examination of CityFlow revealed two significant drawbacks that influenced my decision:

One of the primary concerns with CityFlow, already briefly stated in Section \ref{sec:evaluation-environments}, is the absence of rigorous calibration and evaluation within the general transportation community. In contrast, SUMO has been widely embraced and validated by transportation researchers and professionals. While CityFlow claims to produce equivalent output to SUMO, this assertion is primarily based on results from simplified grid network scenarios. These scenarios may not capture the complexity and nuances of real-world urban traffic dynamics. SUMO, on the other hand, benefits from extensive calibration and evaluation, making it a trusted tool in the transportation field.

CityFlow's common benchmark scenario, the Manhattan, NY network, is often cited as representing a real-world city layout and demand. However, the support for this claim is limited. In contrast, SUMO offers a rich array of benchmark scenarios, including those derived from actual urban environments, making it a more versatile choice for simulating real-world traffic conditions. This versatility aligns with my research goal of optimizing urban traffic flow, which requires realistic modeling and evaluation.

For my thesis on optimizing urban traffic flow using reinforcement learning-based traffic light control, it was crucial to select a simulation tool that not only provides a robust and well-validated framework but also allows for the accurate representation of urban traffic scenarios. SUMO's extensive calibration, evaluation, and support for various real-world scenarios make it the ideal choice for my research objectives.
